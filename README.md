## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This project helped me strengthen my understanding of flexbox alignment and responsive design.

- I also practiced using hover effects to make the buttons more interactive and user-friendly.

- Example of a simple hover effect I used:

.social-link-container > a:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  cursor: pointer;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}

### Continued development

I plan to experiment with CSS Grid to create more complex layouts.
